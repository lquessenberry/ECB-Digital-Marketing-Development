## Digital Inbound Marketing

---

### Digital Presence

We focus heavily on inbound marketing to reduce wasteful advertisement spending and get more interaction out of our customers.

---

### Opportunities

- Online Retail Sales (New Territory)
- Online Membership and Remarketing Opportunities
- Branding and Legitimacy via Branded Apps
- Visualizers for Top of Funnel Acquisition

---

### App Used as Another Funnel

- Drip emails
- Inbound CTA's
- Sign Up For Accounts

---

### Web Dev / App Review
#### Cliqstudios / Pros:
- Clean design.
- Design language is consistent.
- Cabinets are delivered to the home for free. (Likely absorbed into price.)
- Quick Quote feature is simple and has a nice CTA at the end of the process.
- Scores an **87/100** on Hubspot Page Grader.
- Scores a **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Web Dev / App Review
#### Cliqstudios / Cons:
- Slow website. üê¢
- Shopping cart is only used for samples. (What?!)
- Quote checkout is separate from cart checkout. (No reason for this.)
- You literally can't use the shopping cart to buy cabinet pieces on a cabinet ordering website. You have to use their convoluted cabinet quote software or phone it in even though there's a cart icon in the main navigation. This is very confusing.

---

### Current Website
#### Our Current Pros:
- Useful navigation.
- Fast loadtimes.
- Heavy organic traffic acquisition.
- Scores **91/100** on Hubspot Page Grader. üé§üíß
- Scores **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.
- Product Search.
- Consistent design language.
- Provides a ton of Inbound Marketing opportunites.

### Current Website
#### Our Current Setbacks:
- Design could be cleaner
- Search is bulky and inaccurate at times
- No E-Commerce
- No project management
- No bill of material calculators
- No interactive cabinet quote builder
- Store chooser is sometimes a burden

---

## Obstacles

---

### Bumps in the Road

None of the above technologies can be built until we have a foundation for future development that allows us to build upon an API that integrates our inventory, pricing, and other vital data from Bistrack into said API.

---

### Bumps in the Road

We currently have only barely scratched the tip of the iceberg and will have several months of discovery, development, and testing ahead of us before we can be completely sure of how we intend to build web and mobile applications on our current data.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Bistrack, ~~to my knowledge~~, offers no API for their customers. Their web services are limited at best and do not offer the opportunities that we need in order to complete these challenges. We will literally be developing their missing features for ourselves by using techniques made widely available to true web developers.

<kbd>Bistrack is in development for an API. It won't be ready until early-mid 2019 for testing.</kbd>

---

### Bumps in the Road

In other words, they're going to be envious of the development we complete for ourselves.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Within the company, our road blocks outside of software development will deal primarily with physical and accounting operations.

---

Some considerations to consider are:
- Logistics & Returns
- Sales tracking by store
- Tax Laws & Payment processing
- Order Fulfillment & Management
- Customer support

---

## Roadmap and Itinerary

---

## Website Development (8-12 months)

---

- Set up development environments for Bistrack, Drupal 8, and DreamFactory. Proof of concept complete. **In progress.**

<kbd>Update:</kbd> Servers are spun up and ready. Proof of concept is beginning development.

---

- Contract top developers for Drupal 8 Commerce. **In progress.**

<kbd>Update:</kbd> Tag1, ColdFront Labs, and Commerce Guys have all been initiated.

---

- Open a dialog with Epicor to discover their web processes and develop our own methods and functions around their suggestions. **Contact Made**

<kbd>Update:</kbd> Bistrack API is more than a year away from testing.

---

- Begin development of API and Drupal 8 bridge for websites. (DreamFactory Configuration) **In progress**

<kbd>Update:</kbd> Testing and development between us and ColdFront Labs on the wsdata module for Drupal has begun.

---

- Build website with shopping cart, memberships, wishlists, calculators, and quote interaction. **To Be Continued**

---

- Test with the integration into the dev backup version of Bistrack. **To Be Continued***

---

- Go live.

---

## Application Development

---

#### App Development (TBD)

1. Determine Prerequisites.
2. Discovery Process (Several Months)
3. ETA is yet to be determined.
4. Rough Estimates

---

### App Development Introduction

Lowes and Home Depot are the flagship apps of retail home improvement apps for iOS and Android. Cliqstudios does have an interactive cabinet calculator that could be translated into some sort of application feature. Linear feet and area calculators would be something that we could provide online as well as in a dedicated iOS/Android app.

---

### App Development Introduction

In addition to that, it is most certainly possible to integrate a SKU/Barcode based scanning feature into an app for product identification within our stores. This would allow customers to put together a list of items and figure a bill of materials based on unit of measure by the price per unit.

---

### App Development Introduction

Several of our flooring and stone vendors have visualizers that allow the customer to customize their remodeling experience using samples of flooring tiles, stone, and more.

#### Visualizers

## Prerequisites

---

### App Development Prerequisites

1. Data Standardization
2. Data Accessibility
3. Website Integration
4. User Integration

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Our data entry methods are **fractured** at best.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Bistrack is only a **fraction of the battle.**

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

**Images, Graphics, and Media** are scattered.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Cabinet lines **aren't** even in a database.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Our website isn't even integrated with our data, so how can we expect to build an app at this point?

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Bottomline: Data entry and integrity are a must.

---

## Discovery

---

### App Development
#### Discovery Process (Several Months)

Each App Platform has a minimum of 150 days of development and at least 35 days of design.

---

### App development
#### Discovery process

The discovery process to create the design, user interaction, and logic behind the app will take several days throughout the life of the project, with the brunt of discovery during the planning stages.

---

### App development
#### Discovery process

The discovery process is the intake process where the developer and design teams will work with our team to learn as much as they can about our needs and wants in an app.

---

### App development
#### Discovery process

It is imperative that we solidify a purpose for the app and deliver clear and concise expectations regarding the features of the app to the development team.
