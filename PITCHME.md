### ECB Digital Development
#### Project Development & Google AdWords Performance
By Lee Quessenberry

---

### Digital Presence

We focus heavily on inbound marketing to reduce wasteful advertisement spending and get more interaction out of our customers.

---

### Inbound Marketing

Inbound marketing is focused on attracting customers through relevant and helpful content and adding value at every stage in your customer's buying journey. With inbound marketing, potential customers find you through channels like blogs, search engines, and social media.

---

Unlike outbound marketing, inbound marketing does not need to fight for potential customers attention. By creating content designed to address the problems and needs of your ideal customers, you attract qualified prospects and build trust and credibility for your business.

---

### <span class="gold">Us vs. Them</span>

"I‚Äôd like for you to explore state of the art functions. Scanning our UPC codes, typing in measurements and cost/savings appear. Look at Cliqstudios. You can actually build your own cabinets."

<em>Steve Brimner</em>

### Cliqstudios / Pros:
- Clean design.
- Design language is consistent.
- Cabinets are delivered to the home for free. (Likely absorbed into price.)
- Quick Quote feature is simple and has a nice CTA at the end of the process.
- Scores an **87/100** on Hubspot Page Grader.
- Scores a **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Cliqstudios / Cons:
- Slow website. üê¢
- Shopping cart is only used for samples. (What?!)
- Quote checkout is separate from cart checkout. (No reason for this.)
- You literally can't use the shopping cart to buy cabinet pieces on a cabinet ordering website. You have to use their convoluted cabinet quote software or phone it in even though there's a cart icon in the main navigation. This is very confusing.

---

### Our Current Pros:
- Useful navigation.
- Fast loadtimes.
- Heavy organic traffic acquisition.
- Scores **91/100** on Hubspot Page Grader. üé§üíß
- Scores **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.
- Product Search.
- Consistent design language.
- Provides a ton of Inbound Marketing opportunites.

### Our Current Setbacks:
- Design could be cleaner
- Search is bulky and inaccurate at times
- No E-Commerce
- No project management
- No bill of material calculators
- No interactive cabinet quote builder
- Store chooser is sometimes a burden

### Bumps in the Road

None of the above technologies can be built until we have a foundation for future development that allows us to build upon an API that integrates our inventory, pricing, and other vital data from Bistrack into said API.

---

### Bumps in the Road

We currently have only barely scratched the tip of the iceberg and will have several months of discovery, development, and testing ahead of us before we can be completely sure of how we intend to build web and mobile applications on our current data.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Bistrack, to my knowledge, offers no API for their customers. Their web services are limited at best and do not offer the opportunities that we need in order to complete these challenges. We will literally be developing their missing features for ourselves by using techniques made widely available to true web developers.

---

### Bumps in the Road

In other words, they're going to be envious of the development we complete for ourselves.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Within the company, our road blocks outside of software development will deal primarily with physical and accounting operations.

---

Some considerations to consider are:
- Logistics & Returns
- Sales tracking by store
- Tax Laws & Payment processing
- Order Fulfillment & Management
- Customer support

---

### Roadmap and Itinerary

---

### Website Development (8-12 months)

---

- Set up development environments for Bistrack, Drupal 8, and DreamFactory. Proof of concept complete. **In progress.**

---

- Contract top developers for Drupal 8 Commerce. **In progress.**

---

- Open a dialog with Epicor to discover their web processes and develop our own methods and functions around their suggestions. **Contact Made**

---

- Begin development of API and Drupal 8 bridge for websites. (DreamFactory Configuration) **In progress**

---

- Build website with shopping cart, memberships, wishlists, calculators, and quote interaction. **To Be Continued**

---

- Test with the integration into the dev backup version of Bistrack.

---

- Go live.

---

#### App Development (TBD)

1. Determine Prerequisites.
2. Discovery Process (Several Months)
3. ETA is yet to be determined.
4. Rough Estimates

---

### App Development Introduction

Lowes and Home Depot are the flagship apps of retail home improvement apps for iOS and Android. Cliqstudios does have an interactive cabinet calculator that could be translated into some sort of application feature. Linear feet and area calculators would be something that we could provide online as well as in a dedicated iOS/Android app.

---

### App Development Introduction

In addition to that, it is most certainly possible to integrate a SKU/Barcode based scanning feature into an app for product identification within our stores. This would allow customers to put together a list of items and figure a bill of materials based on unit of measure by the price per unit.

---

### App Development Introduction

Several of our flooring and stone vendors have visualizers that allow the customer to customize their remodeling experience using samples of flooring tiles, stone, and more.

---

### App Development Prerequisites

1. Data Standardization
2. Data Accessibility
3. Website Integration
4. User Integration

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Our data entry methods are **fractured** at best.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Bistrack is only a **fraction of the battle.**

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

**Images, Graphics, and Media** are scattered.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Cabinet lines **aren't** even in a database.

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Our website isn't even integrated with our data, so how can we expect to build an app at this point?

---

### App Development Prerequisites
#### Data Standardization

Bottomline: Data entry and integrity are a must.
